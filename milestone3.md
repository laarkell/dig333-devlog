## Milestone 3: Gathering materials, planing design, creating LED matrix!

### Planning:
- want to use 15x15 LEDS, need to buy 250
- 2D array (decided not to do 3D because the phases wouldn't be as clear)
- LEDs, then a layer of acryllic, then i will solder the wires of the LEDs together and connect them underneath, then another layer of acryllic (see image with drawings below)

### Sketches of designing and planning:

- run code with matrix
- trial and error
