## Context

Brian Merchant, Everything Thatâ€™s Inside Your iPhone Motherboard, (2017) 
- Summary: This article explains an experiment done to find out whats really in an Iphone. The phone is pulverized and then it's remaining elements are anlyzed and it was found that the elements in the phone cost around $1 in total. The author then discloses that treacherous mines that utilize child labor and terrible practices are where the contents of our phones have been traced.
- Quote: "So, according to Michaud's calculations, producing a single iPhone requires, roughly, mining 34 kilos of ore, 100 liters of water, and 20.5 grams of cyanide."
- Comment: It is very hard to look at an Iphone and think back to the elements it was made out of and where they came from, but it is important to understand the roots of the devices we use everyday.
- Question: Some of the mines and practices that are behind all iphones are terrible, but what are the alternatives? Are there good, reliable, safe alternatives?

Rachel Swaby, One Man's Nearly Impossible Quest to Make a Toaster From Scratch, (2009)
- Summary: This article is all about how designer Thomas Thwaites set out to build a toaster starting with the lements pulled from the earth. The proccesses to obtain each metal he decides to use are intense, unaccessible, and comlicated. In the end he was able to construct a replicate toaster using makeshift materials. However, it didnt even work!
- Quote: "It only took him nine months, several trips across country lines, and a many moments of lateral thinking.
He did plug it in once, but because he wasn't able to make insulation for the wires, the toaster started melting itself about 5 seconds in."
- Comment: I have always loved mkaing pottery because it is a simple process that only requires a few tools and tricks and a kiln. The items we buy today you need so much more to make and many things cannot be remade by hand, especially since the accesibility to materials is so tricky.
- Question: Is it possible to live life only using things you make by hand? Can you still live a modern life this way? Are there things we shouldn't manufacture?

Adam Curtis, All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace Part 3, (2011)
- Summary: The third part in this series trilody was titled The Monkey in the Machine and the Machine in the Monkey. This episode talks about humans and machines and digs into a couple theorys on humans being controlled by code or the so called "selfish-gene". It also dives into manufacturing and the abuse and improper conduct used in order to keep making machines and technology.
- Quote: "The equation has had enormous implications because if everything we did, whether good or bad, was actually a rational strategy computed by the codes inside us."
- Comment: I really enjoyed this series, while it was hard to follow at times, it had great ideas and really kept you thinking and questioning the world we live in. 
- Question: One question I had left after watching this series, was if there were to be another episode, what would it be on? What was missing in regards to modern cultures connection with technology?
