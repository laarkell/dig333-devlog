## Context

Brian Merchant, Everything That’s Inside Your iPhone Motherboard, (2017) 
- Summary: This article explains an experiment done to find out whats really in an Iphone. The phone is pulverized and then it's remaining elements are anlyzed and it was found that the elements in the phone cost around $1 in total. The author then discloses that treacherous mines that utilize child labor and terrible practices are where the contents of our phones have been traced.
- Quote: "So, according to Michaud's calculations, producing a single iPhone requires, roughly, mining 34 kilos of ore, 100 liters of water, and 20.5 grams of cyanide."
- Comment: It is very hard to look at an Iphone and think back to the elements it was made out of and where they came from, but it is important to understand the roots of the devices we use everyday.
- Question: Some of the mines and practices that are behind all iphones are terrible, but what are the alternatives? Are there good, reliable, safe alternatives?

Rachel Swaby, One Man's Nearly Impossible Quest to Make a Toaster From Scratch, (2009)
- Summary: This article is all about how designer Thomas Thwaites set out to build a toaster starting with the lements pulled from the earth. The proccesses to obtain each metal he decides to use are intense, unaccessible, and comlicated. In the end he was able to construct a replicate toaster using makeshift materials. However, it didnt even work!
- Quote: "It only took him nine months, several trips across country lines, and a many moments of lateral thinking.
He did plug it in once, but because he wasn't able to make insulation for the wires, the toaster started melting itself about 5 seconds in."
- Comment: I have always loved mkaing pottery because it is a simple process that only requires a few tools and tricks and a kiln. The items we buy today you need so much more to make and many things cannot be remade by hand, especially since the accesibility to materials is so tricky.
- Question: Is it possible to live life only using things you make by hand? Can you still live a modern life this way? Are there things we shouldn't manufacture?

Adam Curtis, All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace Part 3, (2011)
- Summary: The third part in this series trilody was titled The Monkey in the Machine and the Machine in the Monkey. This episode talks about humans and machines and digs into a couple theorys on humans being controlled by code or the so called "selfish-gene". It also dives into manufacturing and the abuse and improper conduct used in order to keep making machines and technology.
- Quote: "The equation has had enormous implications because if everything we did, whether good or bad, was actually a rational strategy computed by the codes inside us."
- Comment: I really enjoyed this series, while it was hard to follow at times, it had great ideas and really kept you thinking and questioning the world we live in. 
- Question: One question I had left after watching this series, was if there were to be another episode, what would it be on? What was missing in regards to modern cultures connection with technology?



## Experiments


### Experiment #6: Very Simple Switching

![IMG_8988](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70282901/156276956-e0fa647a-7924-4036-b58a-bb15e0882a0f.jpg)

#### Outcomes & Takeaways
- When both buttons are pressed there is complete connection and the LED lights up
- when no buttons or one button is pressed then the LED doesn't light up
- The buttons either have no connection or have complete connection between the two connections to the button

#### Comments & Variations
- We only used the button switches becasue we didn't have the toggle swiches
- Therefore we used less connections as seen in the image below

#### Questions
-Is there a way to connect the two outside connections on the toggle switch to eachother?

### Experiment #7: Investigating a Relay

![IMG_8989](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70282901/156277017-c6536cfc-b10a-4bfe-87f3-823c1cb4d2e2.jpg)

#### Outcomes & Takeaways
- We determined there were certian connections that needed to be made on the relay in order to have the multimeter beep when the button was pressed
- There were some connections when the multimeter beeped no matter what and some when it didnt beep at all, therfore only certian pins in the relay are connected
- We set the multimeter on continuity which I understand to mean that there is something running through the circuit (voltage, current) and it beeps when it's continuous

#### Comments & Variations
- This experiment was tricky, our relay only had 5 total pins and it took us a while to determine which pins need to be connected to be continuous when the button is pressed
- The inside of a relay is shown below and this quote explains all the parts, "The coil, A, generates a magnetic attraction pulling lever B downward. A plastic extension, C, pushes outward against exible metal strips and moves the poles of the relay, D, between the contacts."

#### Questions
- What would a relay be used for? Whats a common application of it?

### Experiment #8: A Relay Oscillator

#### Outcomes & Takeaways
- A relay has two points that are connected and then the other 3 are the 2 points of a switch as shown by the image:

- The relay can oscillate between it's two states buzzing back and forth
- A capacitor can be described as a tiny rechargable battery, it charges and discharges

#### Comments & Variations
- Our relay only had 5 total pins, 3 for the switch and 2 that were connected so we had to alter from the diagram in the book
- 5 steps to find errors: check voltages, check placement, check connection, check component orientation, and check for damage!
- Capacitance is measured in Farads

#### Questions
- How big can capacitors get? 
- If the breadboard is burned, is the whole thing no good?

### Experiment #9: Time and Capacitors

![Screen Shot 2022-03-01 at 8 36 55 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70282901/156278444-f08e6f45-fc91-4af6-b9ec-99850c877f55.png)

#### Outcomes & Takeaways
- The speed that a capacitor charges varies base on the resistant of the circuit, reffered to as the time constant where T=RC and R is the resistance, and c is the capacitance
- The charging of a capacitor is not constant, it slows down as charge builds up and looks liek the graph below
- ![Screen Shot 2022-03-01 at 8 40 18 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70282901/156278437-60ba77b2-827c-46ba-812e-309cdf50aa4a.png)


#### Comments & Variations
- A capacitor blocks Direct Current (DC voltage)
- The button on the capacitor removes any charge built up on it
- Capacitors work both ways, current can go through both ways 

#### Questions
- Can you blow out a capacitor? In other words, can you apply too much voltage?

### Experiment #10: Transistor Switching

![Screen Shot 2022-03-01 at 8 44 41 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70282901/156278801-422993a3-2c55-479c-81e3-5cbd942f3867.png)

#### Outcomes & Takeaways
- 2N2222 transistor is the most widely used semiconductor of all time
- Transistors have 3 components: Collector, Base, and Emitter
- There are PNP and NPN transistors: NPN are activated by positive voltage on the base relative to the emitter and PNP are activated by negative voltage on the base relative to the emitter
- Potentiometer can be used to create a voltage divider by varying internal resistance, to provide a full range of voltages

#### Comments & Variations
- Never get into the habit of letting electricity run through you (even in our small circuits)
- Transistors are easily damaged and fragile

#### Questions
- Since transistors require power to perform their function, what do they do with no power? When would it matter that they dont need power?
