## Week 1

### Context

In the TEDx video Physicality and Conviviality, Tom Igoe explains that physical computing aims to make people think about computation from the point of what people physically do. The first questions they ask when creating projectsare, what is the person going to do? What physical actions are they going to take? One great example is a flight simulator that was created by first creating wings and then using sensors. The speaker actully helped start a line of microcontrollers by the company Arduino that are created for beginners that has open source hardware. These microcnotrollers can be used to make a guitar, art, tools like laser cutters and 3D printers, and many other things. He also explains the benefit of publiv polocy and Peer to Patent, which is a site that was created to help the patent office by allowing others to review patent applications and leave comments. Tom says, "The devices that we make and the devices that we use, what they do matters less than the relationships we make through them and how they change out relationships." and then continues to leave the presentaion by encouraging everyone to get thier hands dirty. I agree that technology should be centered around out bodies, helping us and what we can do. One comment I have from the video is that I have  never looked at coding and hardware in the way of what peoples actions are and what they physically do. I think this is a great way to adapt technology to our abilities and maximize what we can do into our technology instead of just using the tip of our pointer finger, like we do on our phones and touch screens. A follow up question I have for disucssion or for the speaker in the video is, Do we need to replace the technology we have now? Or shoudl we focus on improving it? I am curious what he would answer especially with his ultimate goal to have technology improve and strengthen the relationships we have.
