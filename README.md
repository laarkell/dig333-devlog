## Week 1

### Context

In the TEDx video Physicality and Conviviality, Tom Igoe explains that physical computing aims to make people think about computation from the point of what people physically do. The first questions they ask when creating projectsare, what is the person going to do? What physical actions are they going to take? One great example is a flight simulator that was created by first creating wings and then using sensors. The speaker actully helped start a line of microcontrollers by the company Arduino that are created for beginners that has open source hardware. These microcnotrollers can be used to make a guitar, art, tools like laser cutters and 3D printers, and many other things. He also explains the benefit of publiv polocy and Peer to Patent, which is a site that was created to help the patent office by allowing others to review patent applications and leave comments. Tom says, "The devices that we make and the devices that we use, what they do matters less than the relationships we make through them and how they change out relationships." and then continues to leave the presentaion by encouraging everyone to get thier hands dirty. I agree that technology should be centered around out bodies, helping us and what we can do. One comment I have from the video is that I have  never looked at coding and hardware in the way of what peoples actions are and what they physically do. I think this is a great way to adapt technology to our abilities and maximize what we can do into our technology instead of just using the tip of our pointer finger, like we do on our phones and touch screens. A follow up question I have for disucssion or for the speaker in the video is, Do we need to replace the technology we have now? Or shoudl we focus on improving it? I am curious what he would answer especially with his ultimate goal to have technology improve and strengthen the relationships we have.


## Week 2

### Context

We had two readings this week, the first was an article in the MIT Review by Sanjay Sarma and was titled, The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World. This article talks about the internet of things, which is the term used for a network of objects embedded in an electronic system that optimizes data collection. Sarma emphasizes that the internet of things is going to affect every aspect of life and that if it’s not regulated that till lead to weakness. He suggests the creation of procedures, standards to control and lists three primary concerns to focus on. I understand that lack of encryption can lead to hacking and data stealing but I am unsure what data will be breached by the objects that are described in the article. For example, he talked about teslas and google cars being examples. But what data will be leaked form these and why is it detrimental? The second reading was titled, The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours. This article talks about "The internet of shit" which is a twitter account that is all about devices that are being connected to the internet. The author talks about how the internet devices just lead to more problems, often break more easily or need updating more often, and are more complicated. Here is a quote from the author that talks about his view on these devices, "The lure of these devices when presented against the backdrop of old, offline devices is obvious: they could change your whole life and in some ways for me, they have, but the headaches are only beginning, and selling them as life-changers without commitment is irresponsible, and there’s no transparency about how they could change in the future." One question I have for this author is as follows, is there a future where the internet connected devices are beneficial to us? And how will we know when this is, or which ones are? If not, how can we avoid letting everything become internet connected?


### Experiments

<!-- List each Platt experiment / Monk recipe outcome, adding notes, photos, schematics, captions to show your work. -->
Platt experiments:

1. Taste the power
   1. Notes:
        
        a. Current is related to the load or the resistance
       
       b. Didn't taste much!
  
   1. Positive voltage runs from the positive to the negative battery terminal and negative flows the other way.
   1. Are you an insulator or a conductor?

2. Lets abuse a battery
   1. ![Screen Shot 2022-02-08 at 8 21 54 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70282901/153103799-0ff97fc4-e60d-4067-8c76-9b6bfee938a9.png)
   1. Never touch the positive and negative ends of a battery together or it will smoke and smell.
   1. If you smell something smokey, what is the first thing you should disconnect in your circuit?

3. Your first circuit
 
   1. ![Screen Shot 2022-02-08 at 8 10 33 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70282901/153102695-da3e90d4-37b2-4649-a600-d7722783eebe.png)
   1. Notes:
        
        a.  It does not matter what order you put the pieces in
        
        b. Resistors have a color code that allows you to determine their resistance
        
        c. Multimeter can measure voltage, current, and resistance
        
        d. Resistor is used to block some voltage from the LED
   
    1. Diodes or LEDs have to face the right direction in order to work properly.
    1. What do the colors on a resistor mean?

4. Varying the voltage
     1. Notes:
       
       a. Potentiometers allow you to vary the voltage
        
        b. Turning the knob on the potentiometer changes the resistance
        
        c. Doesn't matter if you put the pot before or after the LED
        
        d. Ohm's Law: V=IR
        
        e. Amount of voltage changes the brightness of the LED, more the brighter, but not too much!
   
    1. You can ignore the resitance of the wires when doing ohm's law calculations.
    1. If you want to combine batteries how do you connect them? Which terminal to which terminal?

## Week 3

### Context

The critical engineering manifesto lists out 10 ideals of what a critical engineer should do or be like. It was written by the Critical Engineering working group. All of the ideals are about going beyond what the machine shows and the obvious parts and advises you to dig deeper. One point that specifically stuck out to me was number 7, "The Critical Engineer observes the space between the production and consumption of technology. Acting rapidly to changes in this space, the Critical Engineer serves to expose moments of imbalance and deception." This one stuck out to me because technology is extremely controlled and driven by money and capitalism and it is important to be aware of this and work to counter it's effect on quality. The next piece we read was an Artist profile on Julian Oliver written by Jason Huff. Julian Oliver was one of the writers of the engineering manifesto. He talks about how engineering is one of the most transformative languages and that it is important to pay attention to the bigger picture as well as the small details. The article also outline a couple more projects Oliver contributed to as well as some questions that address his background and interests. One of the questions that I would ask Oliver is, do you determine what projects you are going to work on based on the company or based on the benefit of the goal? The movie we had to watch this week was called Love and Power and is the first part of  the series All Watched over by the Machines of Loving Grace. This episode talks about the idea that computers can create a ne world and how this idea came to be due to a series of events. Some of the reasons were self-interest, capitalism, and the ideals of silicon valley.


## Week 4

### Context

This week we read two stories by Philip K. Dick. The first one was called, Pay for the Printer which follows the life of Allen Fergesson and charlotte in Detroit. They are living in a future world devastated by war and falling apart. They seem to rely on these alien machines called Biltongs that build and replicate things. It seems the world has fallen apart because people stopped doing things for themselves and just relied on something else to do everything for them. One quote that was striking from the story was from right after Charlotte apartment building was falling down and they realized even the Biltongs were dying, “She was silent. They all knew. The Biltong had become sterile in their struggle to keep the human race alive. Dead eggs, progeny hatched without life…” The second story was titled, The Preserving Machine, and was another science fiction tale all about someone named Doctor Labyrinth who imagines a preserving machine to preserve music in the form of animals. It creates some funky things like a Beethoven beetle. One follow up question I have from this story is what would the world be like if cultures and history were perfectly preserved? What would change if we knew everything about the past? Lastly, I watched part 2 of All Watched over by machines of loving grace. This episode called, the Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts, talks all about how we perceive the natural world and how it’s based on misconceptions about ecology and evolution.
